Here it is crucial to deliver  information about the current progress of the replacement activity.\n",

In particular, there is some code that uses a library called \"Java Database Connectivity\" (or \"JDBC\" for short). This library has many custom code that is now supported by a more advanced library called \"Java Persistence API\" (or \"JPA\" for short). Show the progress in regards of existing source code lines for both technologies!\n",
